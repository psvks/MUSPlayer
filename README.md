# MUSPlayer
A mp3 Music player for roblox!

## Set up

  As you can see you will not have the option to add new songs.
  
  In your workspace folder, you need to create a folder named `musplayer` 
  Inside that folder you can add your .mp3 files or .ogg files! 

## Credits

  My self and some members of parvus helped me to make this work properly.
